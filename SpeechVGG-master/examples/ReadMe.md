# Example applications of pre-trained speechVGG

Here we present two applications of the pre-trained speechVGG introduced in [(Beckmann et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.09909.pdf):

* Speaker identification (TIMIT dataset) - example of fine tuning the pre-trained extractor to a specific task
* Speech-music-noise classification (MUSAN dataset) - example of the direct deployment of the pre-trained feature extractor
