# Speech-music-noise classification

Example usage of the pre-trained speechVGG for speech-music-noise classification, as applied and evaluated in [(Beckmann et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.09909.pdf).

#### Additional required packages

* Scikit-learn
* matplotlib

#### Data

This example uses [MUSAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08484) dataset available [here](https://www.openslr.org/17/). You should create a folder 'musan' with the following folders (default file structure):

    musan
    |_ music
    |_ noise
    |_ speech

#### now open the jupyter notebook to see how to extract features, visualize them and use them to classify data.
